# Shape Dataset

## Dataset
- a Dataset of Shapes and Vertices for Machine Learning **Classification** and **Regression**.  

## Analysis
### Classification  

Classification is done to determine the type of shape. Images exist in 4 shapes:
- Ellipse
- Rectangle
- Triangle
- Other

Notebooks:
- a Notebook to read the images and prepare data (ETL).
- a Notebook to do Shape classification.
### Regression  
Regression is done to determine the exact size and angle of each shape.   
For each shape, the vertices of the shape are expressed as x,y coordinates.  
Vertices are the extremities that define the shape.

Notebooks:
  - a Notebook to read the images and Vertices and prepare data (ETL) for Ellipses.

I have created this Dataset for my app **[Mix on Pix](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mix-on-pix-text-on-photos/id633281586)**.

The Dataset is in the directory: **data**

## Images 
Images exist in 4 shapes:
- Ellipse
- Rectangle
- Triangle
- Other

It contains images (70px x 70 px x 1 gray channel). In the ETL phase, I separated the data in:

| Set | Total | Other | Ellipse |  Rectangle | Triangle |
| :--------------|---------------:|---------------:|---------------:|---------------:|---------------: |
| Training set |  **21386** images  |  5316  | 5025 |  5737  | 5308 |
| Validation set | **3983** images  |  1130  | 1069 |  860  | 924 |
| Test set | **1923** images  |  841  | 360 |  359  | 363 |
  

### Examples
Images from a Training set:

## Data
### People
Images were mostly generated by asking people I knew to draw Ellipses, Rectangles and Triangles in [Mix on Pix](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mix-on-pix-text-on-photos/id633281586).  
People were aged from 7 to 87. I ask them to draw the way they wanted, slow or fast. In particular, I did not ask to draw nice shape. It was the **intent** while drawing that interested me.
### Tools
I have created tools within [Mix on Pix](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mix-on-pix-text-on-photos/id633281586) to generate 70px x 70px png files for each shape drawn.  
I then used these images to train a model that is used in [Mix on Pix](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mix-on-pix-text-on-photos/id633281586) Auto-Shapes feature.
### Shape of type Other
The first ML model had no **Other** shape. I was initially happy with the excellent accuracy when the drawing corresponded to the intent. But when testing internally with [Mix on Pix](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mix-on-pix-text-on-photos/id633281586), errors while drawing would lead to Ellipse, Rectangle and Triangle recognition. Not a fantastic user experience.    
Moreover, when attacking the more difficult problem of determining the vertices of a shape, the distinction of **Other** shapes became important.

### Difficulty
The difficulty of the classification really depends on the flexibility that we want to implement.  
Let's show some **examples** of various difficulties.
#### Easy
If we force the user to form **very distincts** shapes, the classification is pretty **easy**.  
Ellipse            |  Rectangle | Triangle
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](readme_images/Easy/Ell1.png)  |  ![](readme_images/Easy/Rect1.png)  | ![](readme_images/Easy/Tri1.png) 
  
Why is it easy?
- Shapes are pretty much all closed.
- Only the Ellipse contain curves.
- No extra drawing that can confuse the model.
#### Medium
If we consider that the user may be drawing quickly with a basic shape intent but imperfect drawing, it gets more interesting and harder.  
Ellipse            |  Rectangle | Triangle
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](readme_images/Medium/Ell1.png)  |  ![](readme_images/Medium/Rect1.png)  | ![](readme_images/Medium/Tri1.png) 

Why is it more difficult?
- Some open shapes.
- Rectangles and Triangles may contain curves.
- Extra drawing (like in the ellipse). Too much extra drawing will make the shape fall in the **Other** category.

#### Hard
If we try to go to the limit of what a human can interpret, then it becomes much harder and **really interesting**. Here are 2 sets of hard images.   
Ellipse            |  Rectangle | Triangle
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](readme_images/Hard/Ell1.png)  |  ![](readme_images/Hard/Rect1.png)  | ![](readme_images/Hard/Tri1.png)  

Why is it even more difficult?
- The Ellipses have curves, but can almost be shaped as a Triangle.
- The Triangles can also have curves.
- The Rectangles have some parallel lines, but can contain curves .  

or

Ellipse            |  Rectangle | Triangle
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](readme_images/Hard/Ell2.png)  |  ![](readme_images/Hard/Rect2.png)  | ![](readme_images/Hard/Tri2.png)  


Why is it even more difficult?  
When **drawing quickly**, the intent may only be roughly expressed in the actual drawing:
- An ellipse may not contains a lot of curves.
- Sides may have different lengths. Still the intent must be considered.
- The intent of a straight line may contain curves. 

## Notes
- When training for [Mix on Pix](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mix-on-pix-text-on-photos/id633281586) using a GPU over 300 epochs, I get a validation accuracy around 0.9980
- Once the model is trained, I generated a TensorFlow Lite model that I then use in [Mix on Pix](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mix-on-pix-text-on-photos/id633281586).


## To do
General
- Make a smaller dataset subset?
- Create a DataSheet for the Dataset as described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010.pdf  

Classification
- Rename variables like X_train

Later
- Show model to calculate Vertices
